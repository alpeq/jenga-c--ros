[Above setting are in following order:]

Norm radius // height of the norm. 0.2 seems to be fast 0.375 seems to be good 
Spin radius // norm x spin radius gives the square  0.2 seems to be fast 0.375 seems to be good	
//bigger values give more specificity but also more computation time, on the other hand time vested here, saves time due to less poossible configurations.

Ransac iterations
Inlier threshold // 0.00000155 has given the best results so far. 
Scene path

Feature extraction method (in capitals)
leafsize of the downsampler (density in points pr volume)

WHere is bin size?
